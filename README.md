Virus Hunter is game made in my final class Gam_305. The Objective of the game was to create a game based on viruses that have taken over the planet and plaguing the world is up to you to exterminate all the viruses and save the world.

# Completed Tasks:

According to the curriculum the objective was to create a fully functioning working game which consisted of a main menu, gameplay, success menu, or you lost menu.

In the gameplay, there are three different types of viruses one that tracks and shoots based on the players location, then there is the following by trailing the player when the player gets in a certain distance of the player, and last the virus that tracks you and shoots you but has at least three different spawn locations.

###### Player Controls:

The player uses the basic movement in a computer game default wsad to move character and to look around you use the mouse. 
Pickup Weapons - Press E when close enough

# Things to Do:
Add cursor in the game
Make sure you have a way to see mouse in menu
